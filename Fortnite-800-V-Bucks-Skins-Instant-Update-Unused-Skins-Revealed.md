## Introduction to Fortnite Skins

Fortnite is not just a battle royale game but a social experience where players can express themselves through various skins, emotes, and other cosmetics. The skins in Fortnite are purchased using the game's currency, V-Bucks. Players can earn V-Bucks through gameplay or buy them with real money.

The 800 V-Bucks skins are one of the most popular categories in Fortnite. These skins offer great value for money, typically being priced at a lower rate compared to other premium skins.
